# 🔥 jerapiblaze 🔥

😍 I am just a amateur who use codes to solve daily problems.

📗 I know about C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Batch/Shell, C#, PowerShell. 

😊 I can lean new languages to adapt my own and my projects' requirements.

🐍 Now I'm currently focus on **Python**.

🔗 I own a small blog, but its contents are still in flux, but here you are: [https://jerapiblaze.github.io/](https://jerapiblaze.github.io/)
